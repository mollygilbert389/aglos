# Odd or Even

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.

## Instructions

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `oddOrEven` function to achieve the following:

    * If `num` is evenly divisible by 2, return the string `"even"`.

    * If `num` is not evenly divisible by 2, return the string `"odd"`.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
