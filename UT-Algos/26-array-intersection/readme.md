# Array Intersection

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array that is the intersection of both arrays. An **array intersection** in this activity is defined as the set of same-number pairs between both arrays. There might be multiple pairs of the same number between both arrays, so a number might appear more than one time in the result.

## Instructions

* In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `arrayIntersection` function to achieve the following:

  * Return a new array that contains the intersection of both passed-in arrays.

  * Refer to the following array for an example:

    ```js
    var arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    var arr2 = [3, 4, 5, 6];
    ```

  * Because both arrays contain one `3` and one `4`, the following should be returned:

    ```js
    [3, 4];
    ```

  * Refer to the following array for another example:

    ```js
    var arr1 = [8, 88, 8, 90, 91, 8];
    var arr2 = [90, 8, 8, 15, 3];
    ```

  * Because both arrays contain the number `90` once and the number `8` at least twice, the following array should be returned:

    ```js
    [90, 8, 8];
    ```
