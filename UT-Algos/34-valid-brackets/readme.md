# Valid Brackets

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes in a string and returns `true` if the string contains a valid, matching set or sets of brackets, and `false` if not.

## Instructions

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `validBrackets` function to achieve the following:

    * Return `true` if the string contains a valid set or sets of brackets, else return `false`.

    * For example, given the following string:

      ```js
      var str = "( )";
      ```

    * The following should be returned:

      ```js
      true;
      ```

    * Given the following string:

      ```js
      var str = "{ } [ ( [] ) ]";
      ```

    * The following should be returned:

      ```js
      true;
      ```

    * Given the following string:

      ```js
      var str = "( [ ) ]";
      ```

    * The following should be returned:

      ```js
      false;
      ```

    * Because the brackets -- [ and ) -- are mismatched.
