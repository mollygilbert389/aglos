# Left Rotation

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes an array of integers and a positive integer as arguments. The function should then rotate the elements of the array to the left by the given number.

## Instructions

1. In this file, write code in the body of the `leftRotation` function to achieve the following:

   * Rotate the elements in the given array to the left by the given `positions` number.

     For example, given the following array and `positions` number:

     ```js
     const arr = [1, 2, 3];
     const positions = 2;
     ```

     The given array should be updated to the following:

     ```js
     [3, 1, 2];
     ```

   * If an empty array is provided, the array should not be modified.

2. To complete this problem, simply modify the original array. There is no need to return anything from this function.
