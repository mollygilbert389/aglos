# Arithmetic

In this activity you will be writing code to create functions capable of different arithmetic operations.

## Instructions

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of each function defined to accomplish the following:

    * `add` returns the result of `num1` plus `num2`.

    * `subtract` returns the result of `num1` minus `num2`.

    * `multiply` returns the result of `num1` times `num2`.

    * `divide` returns the result of `num1` divided by `num2`.
