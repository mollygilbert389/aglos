# Factorial

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that returns the factorial of a given number. A **factorial** of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number. For more information, see the [Wikipedia page on factorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).

## Instructions

  * In this file, you will be writing code in the body of the `factorial` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the factorial of the given `num` integer.

    * See the following code for an example:

      ```js
      var num = 3;
      ```

    * Given the preceding number, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      6;
      // 1 x 2 x 3 === 6
      ```

    * If given `0`, the factorial should be `1`. Otherwise, assume that the given number will be a whole positive number.
