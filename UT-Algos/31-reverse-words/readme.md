# Reverse Words

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes a given string and returns a new string with all of the characters in reverse order. You are not permitted to use the built-in `reverse` method.

## Instructions

1. In this file, write code in the body of the `reverse` function that returns a new string that has all of the characters in the given string in reversed order.

   For example, given the following string:

   ```js
   const str = "just keep swimming";
   ```

   The following string should be returned:

   ```js
   "gnimmiws peek tsuj";
   ```
