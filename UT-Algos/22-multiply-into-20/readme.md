# Multiply into 20

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that takes an array of unique numbers and returns `true` if the product of any two numbers is 20; else returns `false`.

## Instructions

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `multiplyInto20()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return `true` if any two numbers in the given array multiply into 20; else return `false`.

    * See the following array for an example:

      ```js
      var arr = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]; // 4 * 5 === 20
      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      true
      ```

    * See the following array for another example:

      ```js
      var arr = [20, -20, 18, 2, 3, 4]; // no two numbers multiply into 20
      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      false
      ```
