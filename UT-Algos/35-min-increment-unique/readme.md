# Min Increment for Unique

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the minimum number of increments needed to make the numbers unique.

## Instructions

  * In this file, you will write code in the body of the `minIncrement` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the minimum number of increments needed to make the numbers unique.

    * For example, given the following string:

      ```js
      var arr = [1, 2, 2];
      ```

    * The following should be returned:

      ```js
      1;
      ```

    * Since the array could be made to be unique by incrementing one of the number `2`s by `1`.

    * If given the following array:

      ```js
      var arr = [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7];
      ```

    * The following should be returned:

      ```js
      6;
      ```

    * Because one of the number 2s could be incremented twice to make 4, and one of the number 1s could be incremented four times to make 5. Together, this is 6 increments total.
