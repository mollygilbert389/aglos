# Is Unique

In this activity you will write code to create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array; else, it returns `false`.

## Instructions

  * In this file you will write code in the body of the `isUnique()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array; else, return `false`.

    * See the following array for an exampl:

      ```js
      var arr = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]; // no number is repeated
      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      true
      ```

    * See the following array for an example:

      ```js
      var arr = [20, -20, 18, 2, 3, 20]; // 20 appears twice
      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      false
      ```
