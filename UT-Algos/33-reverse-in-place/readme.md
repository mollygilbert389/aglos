# Reverse in Place

In this activity, you will write code to create a function that takes an array and reverses the array in place without using the built-in `reverse` method.

> **Note**: To reverse an array "in place" means to reverse the original array without creating a new array. This can be achieved by swapping elements within the original array.

## Instructions

1. In this file, write code in the body of the `reverseInPlace` function to achieve the following:

   * Reverse the array in place without using the built-in `reverse` method.

   * Return the array after it has been reversed.

     For example, given the following array:

     ```js
     const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8];
     ```

     The original `arr` array should be returned, but with its elements in reverse order:

     ```js
     [8, 6, 4, 2]; // this still refers to the original arr array
     ```
