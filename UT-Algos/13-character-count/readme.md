# Character Count

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns an object containing the characters in the string and the number of times they appear.

## Instructions

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `characterCount` function to achieve the following:

    - Create a new object.

    - Loop through each character in the given string and create a new key for each character in the string.

    - The value of the character's key should be the number of times it appears in the string.

    - See the following function for an example:

      ```js
      var str = "Hello World!";
      ```

    - Given the preceding function, the following object should be returned:

      ```js
      { H: 1, e: 1, l: 3, o: 2, ' ': 1, W: 1, r: 1, d: 1, '!': 1 }
